# Sweet_Cars_and_Bids
If carsandbids.com were to have an Android app, this would be it.


I am a big fan of Doug Demuro. He is a car reviews on YouTube I have been watching for at least six years now. He just launched a company called Cars & Bids, a car auction website for cool enthusiast cars, as well as quirky ones. Currently, there is no Android app for it on the Google Play store, and I want to get better at Android so i figured what better way! Work for something I am very interested in and do something I love, making apps! So, this is the app that maybe someday Cars & Bids will use for their company. Fingers crossed.
